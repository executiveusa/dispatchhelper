# Personas and Copy Guidelines

## Primary Persona: The Dispatcher

**Profile:**
- Female, 30-45 years old
- Runs a small trucking operation (3-10 trucks)
- Manages everything: loads, drivers, brokers, paperwork
- Works from home office or truck cab
- Dealing with constant interruptions and stress
- Values efficiency and reliability over bells and whistles

**Her Challenges:**
- Too many systems to check (load boards, Excel, texts, calls)
- Mental load of tracking everything
- Angry brokers when something goes wrong
- Drivers not responding
- Paperwork and compliance stress
- Cashflow anxiety

**What She Needs:**
- Quick answers to "What's on fire?"
- Trust that nothing will fall through cracks
- Easy way to see which trucks are available
- Fast communication with drivers and brokers
- Proof that she's running a profitable operation

## Voice and Tone

### General Principles
- **Conversational, not corporate**
- **Confident, not condescending**
- **Clear, not cutesy**
- **Supportive, not patronizing**

### Examples

#### ✅ Good Copy

**Dashboard:**
- "All clear! 🎉"
- "What's on fire right now?"
- "Which trucks are empty tomorrow?"
- "Who do I need to call back?"

**Problems:**
- "Load L-1234 is running late - broker expects call"
- "Driver Ana hasn't checked in for 4 hours"
- "You're missing POD for 3 delivered loads"

**AI Suggestions:**
- "I can reassign this to Maya - she's closer and has hours"
- "Want me to text the driver to check in?"
- "This broker always pays on time - take the load?"

**Success Messages:**
- "Load assigned! Driver notified."
- "Broker updated with new ETA"
- "You saved 2 hours this week with automation"

#### ❌ Bad Copy

**Dashboard:**
- "System operational status: nominal"
- "Optimize your load distribution matrix"
- "AI-powered predictive insights dashboard"
- "No anomalies detected in the operational pipeline"

**Problems:**
- "Geofence breach detected for asset ID 0x4F2A"
- "SLA risk threshold exceeded"
- "Data inconsistency in electronic logging device integration"

**AI Suggestions:**
- "Utilizing machine learning algorithms to propose optimal allocation"
- "Recommend initiating communication protocol"
- "Historical pattern analysis suggests high probability of payment"

**Success Messages:**
- "Transaction committed to database"
- "Notification dispatched via SMS gateway"
- "Operational efficiency metrics updated"

## Specific UI Copy Guidelines

### Buttons and Actions
- Use active verbs: "Assign Driver", "Mark Delivered", "Call Broker"
- Not passive: "Driver Assignment", "Delivery Confirmation", "Broker Contact"

### Status Indicators
- Use plain language: "On the way", "Delivered", "Problem"
- Not jargon: "In transit", "Consummated", "Exception state"

### Error Messages
- Explain what happened and what to do
- "Couldn't reach the AI right now. Try again?"
- Not: "HTTP 503 Service Unavailable - Retry with exponential backoff"

### Empty States
- Positive and clear
- "No problems right now - nice work!"
- Not: "No data available for display"

### Loading States
- Friendly and specific
- "Loading your loads..."
- "Checking driver status..."
- Not: "Processing request..." (generic)

## Automation Language

When AI takes action, be transparent:

✅ **Good:**
- "I moved Load L-1234 to Driver Maya because she's 20 miles closer"
- "I sent Driver Ana a check-in request - no response in 3 hours"
- "I suggested this load to you because the rate is 15% above your average"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Load reassignment completed via optimization algorithm"
- "Communication event triggered per escalation protocol"
- "Recommendation generated based on historical data analysis"

## Financial Language

Dispatchers care about money:

✅ **Good:**
- "You made $4,200 this week - up $500 from last week"
- "Average rate per mile: $2.45"
- "This load pays $800 for 300 miles = $2.67/mile"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Revenue KPI demonstrates positive YoY growth trajectory"
- "Unit economics optimization enabled"
- "Margin contribution analysis"

## Problem Severity Language

Be clear about urgency:

**Critical:** "URGENT - Broker waiting on your call"
**High:** "Driver late - update broker soon"
**Medium:** "Missing paperwork - finish today"
**Low:** "Reminder: Truck maintenance due next week"

## Respect Her Time

Every word should earn its place:

✅ **Good:** "3 loads ready to assign"
❌ **Bad:** "There are currently three unassigned loads in the system that require driver allocation"

## Encourage Without Patronizing

✅ **Good:**
- "You're running ahead of schedule this week!"
- "All loads assigned - great job staying on top of it"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Wow! You're such a superstar dispatcher! 🌟"
- "You go girl! Keep crushing it!"

## Technical Terms

Use when necessary, but explain:

✅ **Good:**
- "Hours of Service (HOS) - how many hours driver can work today"
- "POD (Proof of Delivery) - signed paperwork from receiver"

❌ **Bad:**
- Assume she knows: "ELD non-compliance detected"
- Use acronyms without explanation

## Cultural Sensitivity

- Avoid gendered stereotypes
- Don't assume tech expertise
- Don't assume business size
- Respect the hard work of dispatch

## Testing Copy

Ask:
1. Would a dispatcher say this out loud?
2. Is it clear what to do next?
3. Does it respect her intelligence and time?
4. Would she feel supported, not talked down to?

If any answer is "no", rewrite.

## Summary

The dispatcher is smart, busy, and stressed. Copy should:
- **Help her win the day**
- **Save her time**
- **Build her confidence**
- **Speak her language**

When in doubt, ask: "Would this make her life easier or harder?"
